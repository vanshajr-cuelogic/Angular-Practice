AngularJS directives allow the developer to specify custom and reusable HTML tags that moderate the behavior of certain elements.

ng-app
Declares an element as a root element of the application allowing behavior to be modified through custom HTML tags.

ng-bind
Automatically changes the text of an HTML element to the value of a given expression.

ng-model
Similar to ng-bind, but allows two-way data binding between the view and the scope.

ng-class
Allows class attributes to be dynamically loaded.

ng-controller
Specifies a JavaScript controller class that evaluates HTML expressions.

ng-repeat
Instantiate an element once per item from a collection.

ng-show & ng-hide
Conditionally show or hide an element, depending on the value of a boolean expression.

ng-switch
Conditionally instantiate one template from a set of choices, depending on the value of a selection expression.

ng-view
The base directive responsible for handling routes that resolve JSON before rendering templates driven by specified controllers.

ngClick
The ngClick allows you to specify custom behavior when element is clicked.

ngSubmit
Enables binding angular expressions to onsubmit events.

ngHref
Using Angular markup like in an href attribute makes the page open to a wrong URL, if the user clicks that link before angular has a chance to replace the with actual URL, the link will be broken and will most likely return a 404 error. The ngHref directive solves this problem.
